# Song-Analysis
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of T-Series
songs data using Tableau.The dataset contains key attributes such
as video ID, channel title, title, description, tags, published date,
view count, like count, favorite count, comment count, video
duration, video definition, and captiondetails. The goal is to utilize
Tableau to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide
a deeper understanding of T-Series songâ€™s performance, popularity,
and user engagement. The analysis aims to uncover trends,
preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and
stakeholders in optimizing their T-Series song content.
